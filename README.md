<h1> what is difference between var and dynamic in flutter ?</h1> <br>


In Flutter, var and dynamic are both used to declare variables, but they have different meanings and implications.

var is used for implicitly typed variables. When you use var, the type of the variable is inferred from the value assigned to it. Once the type is inferred, it cannot be changed. For example:

```
var name = 'John'; // The type of 'name' is inferred as String
```

dynamic, on the other hand, is used for dynamically typed variables. Variables declared with dynamic can hold values of any type, and their types can change at runtime. This is because the type checking for dynamic variables is deferred until runtime. For example:

```
dynamic value = 10; // value is an int
value = 'Hello';    // value is now a String
```

In general, it's recommended to use var when the type is clear from the initialization, and to use dynamic when you need the flexibility to change the type of the variable or when dealing with dynamic data (e.g., JSON). However, overusing dynamic can lead to less readable and maintainable code, so it's advised to use it judiciously.
